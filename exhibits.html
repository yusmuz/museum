      <h2>Cosmology</h2>
      <section class="texttext">
        Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 'The Sky
        Above Us', explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the
        universe around us. We'll locate the various constellations and galaxies
        that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the
        stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: to
        Galileo's telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our
        solar system.
      </section>
      <h2>Evolution</h2>
      <section class="texttext">
        For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrstled witht he
        question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here?
        Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework
        for exploring and understanding our place in this world <br /><br />
        Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know
        today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few
        of the creatures who didn't surivive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the
        Dodos and a number of dinosaurs too.
      </section>
      <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
      <section class="texttext">
        From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology
        are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny
        world. <br /><br />
        For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality
        of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
        medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine
        and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
        penicillin and the first heart transplant. <br /><br />
        Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab,
        but also from observing animals in teh wild. Often our fellow creatures
        have beat us to it.
      </section>
      <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
      <section class="texttext">
        The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
        intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
        applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here.
        You can even say hell and shake the the hand of Rob the Robot.
      </section>
      <h2>Ecology</h2>
      <section class="texttext">
        As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet,
        the more improtant it becomes that scientists explore how to create a
        sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
        <br /><br />
        In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently
        face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But
        we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter
        future.
